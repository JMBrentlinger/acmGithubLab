# ACM Github Lab
This is the repository that contains the materials needed for the lab.

In order to gain access to the lab and answer the assiocated questions, please follow these steps:

1. Download the git_backup.zip file either by downloading the individual file or by cloning the entire repo (bonus points for cloning) 
2. Unzip the file through the use of the command 'unzip' in Git Bash, or unzip it through Windows File Explorer.
3. Begin the challenge!
There are 4 questions that are meant to test your Git and Github skills. Once you find the answers to all 4 questions, please call me over to confirm.
1. What is the email address of the user who was compromised?
2. What is the flag of the user who was compromised?
3. The user is unsure if anything else was compromsied. If there is another service that was compromised, what is it's name? (Answer N/A if no service was compromised)
4. If there is another service that was compromised, what is the password? (Answer N/A if no service was compromised)

If you need any help with the lab, I will be doing a walkthrough towards the end of the meeting!
